## Go Implementation Of a Minecraft Server ##
This is a fully working minecraft server coded in GO(-lang).The goal is to have diffrent versions(/forks) of this project, which are optimized for diffrent tasks.Everything is based on https://wiki.vg/Protocol !More on that in the wiki.

### [Task manager](sourcecode/task_manager) ###
The "task manager" is a script which manages how, when ans where a function(aka. task) should run.In the hole project the task manager is used to run tasks.This allows for easy optimization and adaption for diffrent use cases.


### Why? ###
I had the idea for this while playing on my server with friends.We kept upgrading the hardware dor money but after a few days the server was running on 100%.Then i thought why not just code a minecraft server that is more efficient.I think it is important to give people with less budget, hardware or people who just want to experiment or need a optimized server the ability to do so.
